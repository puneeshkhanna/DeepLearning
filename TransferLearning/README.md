In this notebook, we will implement transfer learning in Python using the pre-trained ResNet model. We will run two experiments -

Freezing the base model weights, adding a few layers to it at the end (fully connected etc.) and training the newly added layers, and
Freezing the first 140 layers of ResNet and retraining the rest.
